The Global Knowledge Base is a searchable repository of Solutions to customer problems, designed to help users quickly find answers to their questions without having to contact support.

**Knowledge base articles can be found here**

- [Global support knowledge base](https://support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/sections/15215649512604-Knowledge-Base)
- [US Government support knowledge base](https://federal-support.gitlab.com/hc/en-us/sections/29015014994068-Knowledge-Base)

**Benefits**:

- Deflects ticket creation.
- Resolves user problems faster.
- Creates consistent, standard answers.
- Creates an environment of trust.
- Gives Support more time to focus on harder issues or improvements.

## Principles

- **Turn it into a habit.** If the issue is worth solving, it is worth saving.
  - Start a knowledge article every time you solve a problem for a customer, a team member or yourself.

- **Accelerate knowledge capture.** Our tools and processes should enhance the speed at which we add knowledge to the Knowledge Base.
  - Capture Knowledge in the moment when the context is clearest and we are able to access customer feedback.
  - Provide feedback as soon as possible if you find a better way to do something.

- **Capture customer context.** Prioritize capturing the right knowledge, in the context of the customer.
  - Focus on documenting the errors and issue as described by the customer for improved findability from other users.
  - Include clear steps and context when documenting solutions. When in doubt, ask, [would Josh Darnit be able to do it?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cDA3_5982h8)

- **Always be iterating.** The Knowledge Base is as much for us as for our customers. We review and update knowledge as we use and reuse it.
  - Reuse is Review: We improve the quality of our knowledge by always iterating.

## How Knowledge Articles differ from GitLab docs

The Knowledge Base and our product documentation are both key elements of GitLab's digital support experience that serve different needs.
See [examples and learn more here](../knowledge-base/docs-vs-kb/)

### Docs

Docs answer: "How does this work?"

- Offers comprehensive information about Product features, architecture and Usage.
- Provides an overview of the current version of our products.
- Often more technical and detailed
- Updated less frequently (New Feature releases)
- Primarily created for engineers, advanced users, Product details

### Knowledge Articles

Knowledge Articles answer: "How do I fix this?"

- Solves problems encountered while using our products.
- provides solutions to common issues and questions
- typically task oriented and includes videos, screenshots
- Updated frequently based on new issues, new workarounds, new troubleshooting and feedback
- Primarily created for customer self-service

## Why you should create a knowledge article

Knowledge articles help users to do tasks, get answers to questions and fix issues they may encounter while using our products.

Did you know that Knowledge can be **INTERNAL** or **EXTERNAL**?!  Knowledge articles arent just for Customers. They are for Internal users as well. Within a knowledge base we offer internal only knowledge that assists our internal team members.

We use *types* of knowledge to efficiently provide the information for our end users. This includes:

- How-To
- Break/Fix
- FAQ (Question and answer)
- Troubleshooting
- Process

## When to create a knowledge article

In short, you should create an article when someone will benefit from the information.

Some questions to consider:

- Will it help customers find information quickly?
- Does it answer a common question / issue?
- Does it document a repeatable way to do something?
- Would this information help a customer get what they need without Support intervention?
- Is this information that may need frequent updates?
- Is this a new issue (with or without a solution) that may cause an influx of support tickets?

## What can be / should be part of a Knowledge Article?

- Overview
- Workarounds, Root Cause, Issue
- Videos (Link to video)
- Screenshots (Be careful to not add screenshots of Personal Identifiable information)
- References (be careful of internal links if the article is external)

### What Training is Available for Knowledge Articles in ZenDesk?

A list of available training can be found in [Knowledge Base Training Resources](../knowledge-base/knowledge-base-training).

## Implementation

We now use a [Sync Repo](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/articles) to create, modify, and  publish knowledge base articles.

Want to see how to create a knowledge article in the Sync repo? Check out our [LevelUp video](https://levelup.edcast.com/insights/creating-an-knowledge-article-in-the-sync-repo-mp)

**Here's what you need to know**

- We are still aligned with Zendesk. THe sync repo will 'sync' knowledge articles with Zendesk to present to customers.
- The Create article button in Zendesk will still be present, however it will direct you to the sync repo (a note will be displayed).
- The knowledge articles will still be present on the knowledge base of our Support Portal.
- Support Engineers will still be able to link knowledge articles and/or documentation to a support ticket by using the search feature.

**What's NOT changing**

- Zendesk remains our tool for support tickets
- Customers see no difference
- Internal article visibility stays the same (look for the 🔒 icon for internal-only content)
- How you view articles is unchanged

- **TL;DR**: Same reading experience, new writing process.

## How to create a knowledge article in the Sync Repo  

This process outlines creating a knowledge article using a WebIDE and Knowledge article template. A [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1oxcPg4IA3yRDAshab31yO8Yf24XqmvY8/view?usp=sharing) has been created to Guide you as a visual.

1. Go to the Sync Repo Project [Articles](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/support/articles)
1. Open a WebIDE (use the period on your keyboard to open the WebIDE)
1. Under the Explorer, select the **Knowledge Articles > Templates** folder.
1. Open the appropriate template file (Breakfix, FAQ, How-To, Process).
1. Copy the entire file content.
1. Select [the appropriate section](../../security/customer-support-operations/zendesk/knowledge-center/sections#current-sections-in-use) under Knowledge Articles. **Note**: If a section does not already exist, follow the steps on [creating a section](../../security/customer-support-operations/zendesk/knowledge-center/sections#creating-a-section).
1. Create a new file under the appropriate section (right-click section > New File...).
    1. Name the File (Your Article Title) and add .md after the title: Example - TitleOfYourKnowledgeArticle.md
    1. Paste the template details you copied into the editor.
    1. Update [metadata fields](./#metadata-fields)
    1. Enter the body (details) of the knowledge articles (remove or add information as needed).
1. Save, Commit and Create the Merge Request (MR)

### Metadata Fields

- **Title**: Change the TITLE (to the title of your knowledge article)
- **Previous Title** (should match the Title)
- **Category**- Knowledge Articles (Leave as is)
- **Section** - Add the section that the article should be in (Administrative, CI/CD Pipeline, Errors, How To, Kubernetes, Licensing and Subscription, Migrations, Other articles, Performance, Security, Upgrades, Troubleshooting).  
- **Author** Your GitLab handle
- **Tags** - Add version specific details.  Example '17.10'
- **Labels** - Product details
- **Instances** - the article will be shown in both Global and Gov knowledgebase. If the article is to only go to Gov, remove the Global. If hte article is to only go to Global remove the Gov line.
- **Public** - is set to TRUE. This indicates the article is PUBLIC VISIBLE. If the article is to be INTERNAL ONLY set to FALSE.
- **convert_markdown** - If the article is in HTML and you convert it to markdown, you must change `convert_markdown` to `true`. If the article is going to stay in HTML format, leave the `convert_markdown` to `false`.
- **source** - add your support ticket details here. Use full ticket URLs so that we can follow the path and determine if it's Gov or Global.
- **Product Categories** - Product Category  [Product Category List](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14CIIVup-tS5HdLyl0wInf-2m50AptauyhG-ZW5uhs-I/edit?gid=1850218997#gid=1850218997)

**Note**: The Workflow will then be started - MR Created, Reviewers must review,  article will be approved and added to the Sync Repo and then visible on our Knowledge base.

## Other ways to Create Knowledge Articles
