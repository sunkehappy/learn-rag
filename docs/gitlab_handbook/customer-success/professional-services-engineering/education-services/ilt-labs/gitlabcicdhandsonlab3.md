> Estimated time to complete: 15 minutes

## Preface

With automated builds and controlled Merge Request pipelines in place, your team faced a critical realization: they were building and deploying code without any automated quality checks. The problems became apparent quickly:

- **Bugs Reaching Production**: Code that compiles successfully still contains logical errors that break functionality
- **No Test Automation**: Developers run tests manually on their local machines, leading to inconsistent coverage
- **Blocking Pipeline Failures**: When experimental tests fail, they halt the entire pipeline, preventing releases even when core functionality works
- **Zero Visibility on Code Quality**: Management has no metrics on test coverage or code health
- **Late Bug Discovery**: Issues are discovered by users in production rather than caught early in development

## Objectives

In this lab, you'll implement automated testing in your CI/CD pipeline, including unit tests for your Go application. You'll learn to organize different test types, handle test failures gracefully using the `allow_failure` keyword, and establish the foundation for comprehensive quality gates that catch bugs before they reach production.

## Task A. Create code and tests

Let’s introduce some code to test, as well as some unit tests for the code.

1. Navigate to your project.

1. Select **+ > New directory**.

1. Set the directory name to **ArrayUtils**.

1. Make sure that **Commit to the current main branch** is selected, and click **Commit changes**.

1. In the **ArrayUtils** directory, select **+ > New file**.

1. Name the file `ArrayUtils.go`. Add the following code to the file:

    ```go
    package ArrayUtils

    func SearchArray(a []int, x int) bool{
      var found bool
      found = false

      for i := 0; i < len(a); i++{
        if a[i] == x{
          found = true
        }
      }

      return found
    }
    ```

1. Select **Commit changes**, add an appropriate commit message, and select **Commit changes**.

1. In your `ArrayUtils` directory, select **+ > New file**.

1. Name the file `ArrayUtils_test.go`. In this file, we will add our unit tests:

    ```go
    package ArrayUtils

    import(
      "testing"
    )

    func TestArraySearch(t *testing.T){
      var a = []int{1,2,3}
      var result bool 
      
      result = SearchArray(a,3)

      if !result{
        t.Fatalf("Expected to find value!");
      }
      
      result = SearchArray(a,5)

      if result{
        t.Fatalf("Expected to not find value!");
      }

    }
    ```

1. Select **Commit changes**, add an appropriate commit message, and select **Commit changes**.

      To run these tests, you can use the command `go test array/ArrayUtils`. Let’s see how we can integrate these tests into our CI/CD pipeline.

## Task B. Create test stage and job in .gitlab-ci.yml

Generally, tests will run inside of the test stage of a CI/CD process.

1. Select **Build > Pipeline Editor**.

1. In the stages section, add the `test` stage before the `build` stage:

    ```yaml
    stages:
      - test
      - build
      - run
      - release
    ```

1. Create a job in the test stage that runs the tests we created for ArrayUtils.

    ```yaml
    test go:
      stage: test
      script: go test array/ArrayUtils
    ```

1. After adding these changes, select **Commit changes**.

1. View the resulting pipeline. You will now see a test stage appear. In the test stage, you will see your test job. When you select the test job, you will see that the job runs the `go test array/ArrayUtils` command. If all of your code is correct, this stage should succeed without any errors.

      Note that when we add the test stage to the start of our stages block, it precedes our other stages such as release. In this setup, if the tests fail for any reason, the stages afterwards will not run. In some cases, we may still want future stages to run if our current job fails. The next task will show you how to do that.

## Task C. Creating a failable job

1. To allow a job to fail, you can add the `allow_failure` attribute to a job. Add the allow_failure attribute to your test job so it looks like the code below:

    ```yaml
    test go:
      stage: test
      script: go test array/ArrayUtils
      allow_failure: true
    ```

1. To test this out, try adding a new test that will always fail. If you are unsure on how to write the test, edit your `ArrayUtils_test.go` file and copy the code below.

    ```go
    package ArrayUtils

    import(
      "testing"
    )

    func TestArraySearch(t *testing.T){
      var a = []int{1,2,3}
      var result bool 
      
      result = SearchArray(a,3)

      if !result{
        t.Fatalf("Expected to find value!");
      }
      
      result = SearchArray(a,5)

      if result{
        t.Fatalf("Expected to not find value!");
      }

      result = SearchArray(a,7)

      if !result{
        t.Fatalf("Expected to find value!");
      }

    }
    ```

    In this example, the final test looks for a value that does not exist in the array, but expects it to find the value. This test will always fail as we are expecting the wrong result.

1. Select **Commit changes** and commit the changes to a new branch called `failable-tests-branch`. Commit the code without a Merge Request.

1. Monitor the progress of your test job.

    > When the test job completes, you will see that the job fails. When it fails, it will show a yellow exclamation mark rather than a red x. This indicates that the job failed as a warning, meaning it won’t prevent future stages from running. You will see that your next stage does execute even with the failure.

1. Navigate to **Build > Jobs**. You will see that the test job is tagged as `Allowed to fail`. This allows you to easily see if a job is allowed to fail or not in a pipeline.

## Postface

With you implementing automated testing, your team shifted from "hope it works" to "know it works" deployments. Unit tests now run automatically on every code commit, catching logical errors and edge cases before code even reaches the build stage. The test stage executes first in the pipeline, ensuring that broken code never wastes resources on unnecessary builds or releases. When the team introduced the `allow_failure` attribute for experimental or non-critical tests, they gained flexibility—allowing pipelines to complete even when optional tests fail, while still maintaining visibility into potential issues through the warning indicators.
