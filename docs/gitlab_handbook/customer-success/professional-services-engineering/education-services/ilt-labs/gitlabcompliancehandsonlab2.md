1. Add a relevant description in the description field.

1. Under 'Configuration Type', switch from "Template" to "Custom".

1. In the **Actions**, set the scan to run a **Secret Detection** scan. Leave all action configurations at default.

1. In the **Conditions** section, set to **Triggers:** for **all branches** using **All pipeline sources** with **No exceptions**.

1. Select **Configure new project with the new policy**.

1. Select **Merge**.

## Task B. Testing your scan execution policy

1. Navigate back to your `Compliance Project` project.
