## Operating model in one paragraph

Enterprise AI is the platform Hub: it builds, governs and supports the AI capability. The ATO is the spoke, a senior role inside the function that owns delivery and bridges Enterprise AI to the function. Champions form the second Hub inside the function, a peer community across sub-teams who drive adoption, pilot agents and surface use cases. The ATO connects the two hubs. Use-case work flows through the ATO. Bugs, security issues and platform feedback flow up directly so the platform learns fast.

## Slack channels

| Channel | Visibility | Members | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| [**#enterprise-ai-collab**](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C0AE5DX6SQJ) | Public | All GitLab team members | Team-member engagement channel. Questions, FAQs, intake support. |
| `#enterprise-ai` | Private | Enterprise AI team | Internal Hub working channel. Roadmap, platform issues, governance, escalation routing. |
| `#ent-ai-ato` | Public | Enterprise AI plus all ATOs | Daily working channel for Hub-ATO collaboration. Default mode for async. |
| `#ent-ai-champions` | Public | Champions across all spokes plus ATOs plus Hub | Cross-spoke Champion community. Learning and consistency, not work intake. |

## Cadence

The cadence is deliberately stepped: lighter while we are small, heavier as we scale. Async-first throughout, with formal forums kept slim.

![Enterprise AI operating cadence at a glance: Daily, async-first in #ent-ai-ato with no mandatory standups. Weekly, AI Engineer to ATO sync. Every two weeks, ATO to exec sponsor, ATO Council, and Champion to ATO sync. Monthly, Champion demo or share-out across the function. Quarterly, Business Review plus cross-spoke Champion show-and-tell.](/images/eta/ai/strategy/operating-cadence.png)

### Daily

Async-first in `#ent-ai-ato`. No mandatory standups across the cohort.

### Weekly

- **AI Engineer to ATO sync.** Minimum once weekly between each ATO and their assigned AI Engineer. More during the launch of a new spoke or an active build (typically two to three times a week), daily during a production push. Async in Slack between syncs. Assignments are reviewed quarterly.
- **ATO to function leadership team.** The ATO joins their function's leadership meeting where appropriate, with a standing agenda slot, so AI work surfaces to the wider function exec team alongside the exec sponsor.

### Every two weeks

- **ATO to exec sponsor.** Updates and reactive prioritisation as priorities evolve.
- **ATO Council.** All ATOs plus Enterprise AI representation. 60 minutes. Mandatory. Show-and-tell, platform updates, shared problems, cross-spoke learnings. This is the de-siloing forum, and it naturally grows in scope and value as more ATOs join.
- **Champion to ATO sync.** 30 minutes. In-function intake and coaching. Daily async happens in `#ent-ai-champions` between syncs.

### Monthly

- **Champion demo or share-out** across the function, hosted by the ATO with Champions presenting.
- Otherwise reserved. Things move too fast in AI for monthly reviews to be the primary lever.

### Quarterly

- **Quarterly Business Review.** Director, Enterprise AI plus ATO plus exec sponsor. 30 minutes, two or three slides:
  - Backwards: use cases shipped, adoption, value delivered.
  - Forwards: planned use cases, dependencies, resourcing.
  - Other: process improvements, feedback, asks.

  Slim and punchy. No death by slides.

## Champion model

**Why Champions.** ATOs cannot personally drive every use case in a 200+ person function. The Champions Hub extends reach into sub-teams and creates a peer community of practice inside the function.

**Nature.** Champions are not direct reports to the ATO. They are a peer community within the function. The ATO is their bridge to Enterprise AI, not their manager.

**Selection.** The ATO selects Champions with sub-team manager sign-off. One per sub-team or squad. 5 to 10% time, formally agreed with the manager.

**What they do.**

- Identify and qualify use cases in their team.
- Pilot agents and workflows.
- Coach teammates inside their sub-team.
- Surface friction and feedback back to the ATO.

**Cadence.** See the [Cadence](#cadence) section above for the full schedule. In short: ATO to Champion sync every two weeks with daily async in `#ent-ai-champions`, a monthly Champion demo across the function, and a quarterly cross-spoke Champion show-and-tell run by Enterprise AI.

**Routing rules.**

- Use-case requests, ideas and project work: **Champion to ATO**. Never direct to Hub.
- Bugs, security issues and platform feedback: **Champion to Hub** directly (via `#ent-ai-champions` or Serval).

## Decision rights

| Decision | Owner |
|---|---|
| Use-case prioritisation in a function | ATO, guided by the exec sponsor's org priorities and company objectives. Larger or cross-functional calls escalate to the Exec Sponsor. |
| How a solution is built (technical approach and best practice) | Enterprise AI, partnering with the ATO. |
| Platform and tooling choices | Enterprise AI |
| Security, data, and governance review | Enterprise AI (accountable platform reviewer with published SLAs) |
| Success metrics in a function | The function's own business metrics. The ATO is responsible for moving them. The Hub aggregates across spokes. |
| Replatforming bespoke tools onto the standard stack | Enterprise AI |
| In-function builds (Champion or individual contributor) | ATO gates for alignment to centralised strategy and standards |
| Champion selection in a function | ATO, with sub-team manager sign-off |
| ATO hiring | Five-step loop; see [AI Transformation Owner](../ato/) |

## Escalation path

When something is on fire (broken use case in production, security incident, platform outage affecting a spoke):

1. ATO (or Champion if the ATO is unavailable) raises via **Serval**.
2. Serval routing triggers a notification in `#enterprise-ai`.
3. Hub on-call acknowledges and triages.
4. Hub feeds back into the originating channel (`#ent-ai-ato` or `#ent-ai-champions`).

For non-urgent issues, default to async in `#ent-ai-ato` first.

## Resourcing target

Each AI Engineer pairs with up to two ATOs (a 1:2 ceiling). During the early phase of a spoke (typically the first quarter) we pair closer to 1:1 to accelerate ramp-up. As a spoke matures and a delivery rhythm sets in, the same AI Engineer can support a second one without losing depth.
