## Vision

The Duo CLI group is focused on developing GitLab Duo CLI as an AI-powered command-line interface that enables developers to interact with GitLab's DevSecOps platform using natural language. Our goal is to streamline developer workflows by bringing AI-powered assistance directly to the terminal, where developers spend much of their time.

## Internal Processes

### Development Phases

The Duo CLI is currently in the Dogfooding phase. Our development approach follows these phases:

| Phase | Description | Status |
| -------- | ------- | ------- |
| Ideation | Concept validation and initial research | ✅ Complete |
| MVC | Minimum Viable Concept development | ✅ Complete |
| Dogfooding | Internal Dogfooding | 📍 We are here |
| Beta | Beta Release | 📋 Planned |
| GA | General Availability | 📋 Planned |
