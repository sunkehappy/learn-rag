## Environment Catalog

### Staging-Canary

| Type | Status | Platform | URL | Owner/DRI | Project | Cells | Access |
|------|--------|----------|-----|-----------|---------|-------|--------|
| Permanent | Active | GitLab.com | [staging.gitlab.com](https://staging.gitlab.com) | Infrastructure Teams | N/A | Enabled | All engineers |

**Purpose:** Canary Stage within Staging for capturing mixed deployment issues. Receives deployments before Main Stage rollout.

**Key Features:**

- Has Web, API, Git HTTPS, websockets, registry, pages, shell, and Gitaly services available
- Shares with Main (Staging): Sidekiq, PostgreSQL, Redis, and other data storage (meaning database and feature flags affect both stages)
- HTTP router is enabled
- Topology service is deployed (not serving production traffic yet)

**Access:**

You may already have an account since Production accounts are automatically brought to Staging. Create an access request in the [access-request project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests) and assign to your manager for approval.

Set `gitlab_canary` cookie to `true` in your browser while accessing Staging. Also, there will also be the word “next” in a green box next to the GitLab logo in the top left.

Note: Setting the `gitlab_canary` cookie to `false` can help avoid targeting Canary Stage, but this is not a 100% guarantee since a subset of traffic will be redirected to Canary based on Infrastructure ruleset.

**Automated Testing:**

- Runs two sets of blocking E2E smoke tests: one targeting Staging-Canary, one targeting Staging Main
- Both test sets must pass for deployment to succeed
- Runs full E2E environment-compatible tests

**Access:**

You may already have an account since Production accounts are automatically brought to Staging. Create an access request in the [access-request project](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests) and assign to your manager for approval.
