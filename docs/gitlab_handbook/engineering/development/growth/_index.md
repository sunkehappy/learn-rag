## Vision

Our vision is to make it effortless for individuals and teams to discover, activate, and expand enduring value in GitLab by running a full-funnel growth system that connects acquisition, activation, retention and monetization into measurable, self‑served loops.

    MON["Monetization\nPay for the product"]
    ENG["Engagement\nContinue using the product"]
    RET["Retention\nContinue paying for product"]
    INV["Invite Velocity\nInvite others to the product"]

## How We Work

Working inline with our [values](/handbook/values/), we focus on [iteration](/handbook/values/#iteration) and [collaboration](/handbook/values/#collaboration), working with and across areas of the product our development department counterparts maintain.

We work on the issues prioritized by our product teams including running [experiments](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) on GitLab.com. Growth stage teams have Fullstack Engineers. The reason for this is that the Growth stage has a need for both Frontend and Backend skill-sets, but as a small team, has optimized for team member efficiency to adopt the Fullstack role.

## Shared Processes

Our teams collaborate using shared processes and tools:

- [Operating Model](operating_model_growth.md) - operating rhythm for growth
- [Milestone Planning, Refinement and Estimation](initiative_refinement_estimation) - continuous refinement process and estimation guidelines
- [Engineering DRI for Large-Scale Initiatives](engineering_dri) - managing complex workstreams and epics
- [Modular Code Guiding Principle](modular_code) - why and how we write modular code by default
- [Technical Exploration Guidelines](technical_spikes) - guidelines for research and spike work
- [Growth Experimentation Guidelines](experimentation) - guidelines for growth experimentations

## Experimentation

Growth teams contribute to GitLab [experimentation](/handbook/engineering/development/growth/experimentation/) to make it easier to run experiments and make data driven product decisions on GitLab.com.

## CustomersDot Trials Collaboration

For information about trials ownership and collaborating with the Fulfillment/Monetization team on trials work, see our [Trials Ownership and Collaboration Framework](trials-ownership.md). This framework defines the conceptual ownership model — Growth owns trial entry points; Fulfillment/Monetization owns the deeper trial codebase and all CustomersDot support — along with the decision framework and escalation paths for priority conflicts.
