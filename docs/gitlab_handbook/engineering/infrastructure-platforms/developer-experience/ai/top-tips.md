Practical workflows the DevEx team has found genuinely useful. Add your own when you discover something worth sharing.

## Use Glean to Search Code and Prioritise Your Day

[Glean](https://www.glean.com/) is GitLab's enterprise search tool, connected to our internal systems including GitLab, Slack, Google Drive, and the handbook. Its AI assistant can answer questions across all of these sources in one place.

**Search for code and context:**

Rather than jumping between GitLab, Slack threads, and the handbook, ask Glean directly:

> "Where is the RSpec helper for mocking Gitaly calls?"
> "What was the decision behind how we structure CI job definitions in the main repo?"
> "Find the runbook for broken main branch incidents"

Glean searches across connected sources and surfaces the most relevant results with links.

**Ask for your top priorities:**

At the start of the day, ask Glean's AI assistant to summarise what needs your attention:

> "What are my top priorities today based on my open issues and recent Slack mentions?"
> "Summarise any unread mentions or threads from yesterday that I should follow up on"
> "What issues am I assigned to that have had recent activity?"

**Tips:**

- Glean works best for finding things you know exist but can't locate quickly — use it instead of searching GitLab and Slack separately
- Ask follow-up questions in the same conversation to refine results
- For handbook content, Glean is often faster than the built-in handbook search

## Create GitLab Issues from a Conversation

With the [GitLab MCP server](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/developer-experience/ai/#gitlab-mcp-server) connected, you can ask Claude to create issues directly in GitLab without leaving your editor or browser.

**Example prompt:**

> "Create a GitLab issue in `gitlab-org/gitlab` titled 'Investigate flaky spec in pipeline_spec.rb'. Label it `type::bug` and `team::devex`. Set the description to include steps to reproduce and link to this pipeline run: [URL]."

Claude will call the MCP tool, create the issue, and return a link. Useful for capturing bugs, tasks, or follow-ups mid-flow without context-switching to the GitLab UI.

**Tips:**

- Specify the project path (`namespace/project`) explicitly — Claude won't guess it
- You can ask Claude to include structured content in the description (steps to reproduce, acceptance criteria, links) by describing it in your prompt
- Works well at the end of a debugging session: "Summarise what we found and create an issue to track the fix"

## Fetch MR Comments and Address Them in VS Code

When you have review feedback on a merge request, you can use Claude Code (with the GitLab MCP server) to pull the comments and work through them without leaving VS Code.

**Workflow:**

1. Open Claude Code in VS Code (`Ctrl+Shift+P` → `Claude Code`)
2. Ask Claude to fetch the MR comments:
   > "Fetch the unresolved review comments on MR !12345 in `gitlab-org/gitlab`"
3. Claude retrieves the comments and lists them in context
4. Work through them together:
   > "Address the comment on `app/models/pipeline.rb` line 42 — the reviewer is asking us to extract this into a separate method"
5. Claude makes the edit, you review the diff, and repeat for the next comment

**Tips:**

- Ask Claude to summarise the comments first before diving in: "Give me a grouped summary of the feedback by theme"
- For straightforward nits (style, naming, typos), you can batch them: "Address all the nit comments in one pass"
- For more complex feedback, work one comment at a time and verify each change before moving on
- Once done, you can ask Claude to post a reply on the MR confirming the comments have been addressed

## Enforce Team Standards Automatically with MR Review Instructions

Instead of leaving recurring review comments by hand, codify your standards in `.gitlab/duo/mr-review-instructions.yaml` and let GitLab Duo enforce them on every MR automatically.

**Quick setup:**

Create the file in your repository:

```yaml
instructions:
  - name: Test descriptions
    fileFilters:
      - "spec/**/*.rb"
    instructions: |
      1. Every `it` block description must read as a complete sentence
         describing behaviour, not implementation
      2. Flag tests that assert on too many things — suggest splitting them
```

Duo will include these checks whenever it reviews an MR touching matching files, and will comment with a reference to the rule name when it finds a violation.

**Good rules to start with:**

- Things that require judgement to evaluate — readability, clarity, intent
- Conventions that are too contextual to express as a lint rule
- Patterns your team raises repeatedly in human reviews

**What to avoid:**

Lean towards using static analysis by default when possible, even if using AI to generate static checkers, as it's cheaper, deterministic and surfaced in the IDE before the MR is even opened.

See the MR review instructions section of the [main AI page](../) for a fuller example and the complete YAML reference.

## Use AI for an Initial MR Review Before Human Review

Before assigning reviewers, run your MR through an AI review pass to catch issues early — logic gaps, missing tests, unclear naming, style inconsistencies. This makes the human review faster and more focused on higher-level concerns.

**Workflow in Claude Code:**

1. With your branch checked out, ask Claude to review the diff:
   > "Review the changes in this branch against main. Focus on correctness, test coverage, and anything a reviewer is likely to flag."
2. Claude reads the diff and provides structured feedback
3. Address any issues it raises before assigning human reviewers

Additionally, use [GitLab Duo Code Review](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/duo_code_review.html) directly on the MR for an automated first-pass review comment.

**Tips:**

- Give Claude a focus area if relevant: "Pay particular attention to the database queries — I want to avoid N+1s"
- Ask it to check for missing edge cases: "Are there scenarios this change doesn't handle that the tests don't cover?"
- Treat the AI review as a checklist, not a gate — use your judgement on what to act on
- If the MR is large, ask Claude to prioritise: "List the three most important things a reviewer would raise"

## Fix Failing Pipelines with AI Assistance

When a pipeline fails, AI can help you move from "something is broken" to "here's the fix" faster by analysing logs, identifying root causes, and suggesting or applying fixes directly.

**Workflow in Claude Code:**

1. Grab the failing job log — either paste it directly or, with the GitLab MCP server connected, ask Claude to fetch it:
   > "Fetch the log for the failing job in pipeline #12345 in `gitlab-org/gitlab`"
2. Ask Claude to diagnose the failure:
   > "Analyse this CI log and identify the root cause of the failure"
3. If it's a code issue, ask Claude to fix it:
   > "Apply the fix to the relevant file"
4. If it's a flaky test or environment issue, ask Claude to explain and suggest next steps

**GitLab Duo Root Cause Analysis:**

For pipeline failures on GitLab.com, use [GitLab Duo Root Cause Analysis](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/gitlab_duo/use_gitlab_duo_chat_in_cicd.html) directly in the pipeline UI. Click the failed job, then **"Root cause analysis"** to get an AI-generated explanation without leaving the browser.

**Tips:**

- For long logs, ask Claude to focus: "Look for the first error in this log and ignore subsequent failures that are likely downstream"
- If the fix isn't obvious, ask for hypotheses: "What are the three most likely causes of this failure?"
- For recurring failures, ask Claude to check git history for context: "Has this test file changed recently in a way that could explain this failure?"
- After fixing, ask Claude to check for similar patterns elsewhere: "Are there other tests in this file that could fail for the same reason?"

## Generate Well-Formed Commit Messages

Poorly written commit messages make `git log` and `git blame` much less useful. Use AI to generate commit messages that are accurate, consistently formatted, and follow [conventional commit](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) style.

**With Claude Code**, you can ask directly:

> "Write a commit message for the staged changes. Use conventional commit format with a short subject line and a brief body explaining the why."

Claude reads your staged diff and produces a message grounded in what actually changed — no more "fix stuff" commits.

**Bake your commit format into AGENTS.md:**

Rather than specifying your format on every prompt, add it to your repository's `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md` so all agents pick it up automatically:

```markdown
# Commit Messages
- Use conventional commit format: `type(scope): short description`
- Keep the subject line under 72 characters
- Use imperative mood ("add feature", not "added feature")
- Include a body when the change needs context beyond the subject line
- Valid types: feat, fix, chore, docs, refactor, test, ci
- Always link to the relevant issue number in the body if one exists
```

Once this is in your repo, Claude Code will follow these rules without being asked — including when generating commit messages mid-conversation.

**Tips:**

- If the diff touches multiple concerns, ask Claude to flag it: "Does this diff represent a single logical change, or should it be split into separate commits?"
- For squash commits before merging, ask for a summary commit message: "Summarise all the commits on this branch into a single conventional commit message"
- Review the generated message — Claude bases it on the diff, but you know the intent better than it does
