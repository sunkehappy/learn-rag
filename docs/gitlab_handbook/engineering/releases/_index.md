Looking for product release information? See [release posts](https://about.gitlab.com/releases/categories/releases/), [releases page](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/releases), [What's new](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/administration/whats-new.html), [changelog](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md), or [feature and deprecations overview](https://gitlab-com.gitlab.io/cs-tools/gitlab-cs-tools/what-is-new-since/).

## Overview

GitLab has three different release types:

1. **[Monthly release](/handbook/engineering/releases/monthly-releases/)**: A GitLab version (XX.YY.0) published on the 3rd Thursday of every month, containing new features, bug fixes and performance improvements from successful [deployments on GitLab.com](/handbook/engineering/deployments-and-releases/deployments/).
1. **[Patch release](/handbook/engineering/releases/patch-releases/)**: Bug fixes and security updates for [maintained versions](https://docs.gitlab.com/policy/maintenance/#maintained-versions), published twice monthly.
1. **[Internal release](/handbook/engineering/releases/internal-releases/)**: Private releases for delivering high-severity fixes to GitLab Dedicated within [remediation SLAs](/handbook/security/product-security/vulnerability-management/sla/).

## Release Policy

### Why Release Policies Matter

GitLab follows [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/), which establishes a contract with our customers:

* **MAJOR** versions may contain breaking changes
* **MINOR** versions contain new features (backward compatible)
* **PATCH** versions contain bug fixes only (safe to auto-upgrade)

Customers rely on this contract to make upgrade decisions. Many customers auto-upgrade patch releases without extensive testing because they trust that patches contain only bug fixes. When we violate this contract, we:

* **Erode customer trust** in our entire release process
* **Put customer environments at risk** with unexpected changes
* **Undermine release predictability** that customers depend on for planning
* **Create cascading problems** when rushed releases introduce new bugs requiring additional patches

### What Each Release Type Contains

| Release Type | Contains | Does NOT Contain |
|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Monthly** | New features, bug fixes, performance improvements | N/A - this is the vehicle for all new work |
| **Patch** | Bug fixes, security fixes, performance regressions | New features, feature flag enables, incomplete work |
| **Internal** | Critical bug fixes, security fixes for Dedicated instances | New features, feature flag enables, incomplete work |

For SLO/SLA commitments on bug and security fix timelines, see [Patch release SLO/SLA Commitments](/handbook/engineering/releases/patch-releases/#slo-commitments).

### Ownership When Deadlines Are Missed

When a feature misses the monthly release deadline, the appropriate path is the **next monthly release**, not an exception to release policy.

| Team | Owns |
|------|------|
| Development | Shipping code in the next policy-compliant release |
| Product | Communicating the delay to stakeholders; adjusting roadmap expectations |
| Customer Success | Managing customer expectations; negotiating timeline changes |
| Release | Executing policy-compliant releases that maintain customer trust in GitLab releases |

Release Managers do not own accommodating missed deadlines.

### Exception Process

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Every approved exception **requires** a [Feature Change Lock (FCL)](/handbook/engineering/#feature-change-locks) and a post-release [incident review](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-review/). **These are not optional**.

Exceptions to release policy are rare and require explicit approval outside the Release team.

**Release Managers are authorized to decline requests that violate release policies.** Pressure from Customer Success, Sales, or other teams does not constitute approval for policy exceptions.

If an exception is believed necessary:

1. [**Requestor** documents](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/release/tasks/-/work_items/new?issuable_template=Exception-request) the business justification and customer impact assessment
2. **Requestor** starts a [Feature Change Lock (FCL)](/handbook/engineering/#feature-change-locks) to protect platform stability (**mandatory**)
3. **Requestor** escalates to VP of your organization for sponsorship. The approving leader provides written approval acknowledgment of policy violation
4. **Sponsor VP** requests exception from [Software Delivery Engineering Leadership](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/gitlab-delivery/delivery/#software-delivery-engineering-leadership) or Infrastructure VP Platform.
5. **Release Manager** executes only after receiving written approval
6. **Post-release:** [Incident review](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/incident-review/) to address the root cause of the exception request (**mandatory**)

Exceptions approved without this process set precedent that undermines all release policies.

### Escalation Path

| Situation | Contact |
|-----------|---------|
| Process questions | #releases Slack channel |
| Exception requests | Your Director/VP (not Release Managers) |
| Policy clarification | [Delivery/Platforms leadership](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/gitlab-delivery/#teams) |

## Release Coordination

### Teams Involved

| Team | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| [Release Team](/handbook/engineering/infrastructure-platforms/gitlab-delivery/delivery/) | Deployments, Process coordination; executing policy-compliant releases |
| Infrastructure | Environment updates |
| Security | Vulnerability fixes and disclosure coordination |
| Product | Feature readiness; owning delays when features miss deadlines |
| Marketing | Release communications |

### Communication
