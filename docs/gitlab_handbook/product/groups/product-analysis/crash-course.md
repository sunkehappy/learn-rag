title: Crash Course for Product Stage Resources
description: Overview of the most important Product Analytics related resources for each product Stage
---

## Objectives for this page

This page is intended to provide a crash course style overview of the most important Product Analytics related resources for each product Stage.
As a Product Analyst or other curious GitLab team member, it can be helpful to have a quick and easy reference for each product Stage to quickly understand high-level functionality, key objectives or a distilled product roadmap, and key data resources currently used under a specific Stage or Group within GitLab before jumping in to an analysis.

If this page serves it's purpose, Product Analysts should be able to visit this handbook page before working with a Stage or Group to obtain helpful contextual information without needing to do a scavenger hunt search across dozens of handbook pages to find relevant information.

## Helpful places to start

- [Internal handbook performance indicators (PIs)](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/company/performance-indicators/) - This internal handbook page is a great place to understand the PIs for each Stage / Group to understand what results each team is trying to achieve.

- [Product categories handbook page](/handbook/product/categories/) contains a huge amount of helpful information and defines sections, stages, groups, and categories.

- Need to quickly learn how a certain Stage/Group feature works? [GitLab Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/)

- [Metrics dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/) contains metrics and events collected in Service Ping and Snowplow. For more information visit the dedicated [Analytics Instrumentation Guide](/handbook/product/product-processes/analytics-instrumentation-guide/).

- [Features by Group handbook page](/handbook/product/categories/features/#product-planning) contains a tabular breakdown of features included in each Stage Group by Core, Premium or Ultimate categories.

- [Data Guides](/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog) managed by the Data team.

- [Centralized Metrics](https://10az.online.tableau.com/#/site/gitlab/workbooks/2069845/views): Key reporting dashboard for GitLab product usage metrics.

- The [Technical Marketing handbook page](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/technical-marketing/) contains links to product demos, webinars and release videos.

- GitLab's Fiscal Year runs from February 1 to January 31. [Here](/handbook/finance/#fiscal-year) is a link to GitLab's Fiscal Quarter to Month map.

## Learn about analytics relevant product stage topics grouped by Section

Why are these groupings called 'Stages'? At GitLab, we build a product that supports every **stage** of the DevOps Lifecycle.

### Dev Section

#### Plan Stage

Enable teams to effectively plan and execute work in a single application. This stage enables portfolio planning and management through epics, groups (programs), milestones, etc. to organize and track progress
