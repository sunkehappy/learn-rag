title: Product Data Insights Data Models Cheat Sheet
description: Overview of the most common data models used by the Product Data Insights team
---

## Objectives for this page

This handbook page is intended to provide a high-level overview of the most common data models used by the Product Data Insights team as well as some known nuances and/or caveats about those data models that are helpful to be aware of.

To collaborate on the content in this page, please either submit an MR (preferred) or start a discussion in [this Epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-data/-/epics/771).

## Helpful places to start

- [DBT Docs](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/overview) - This resource contains comprehensive documentation on all available dbt models. When in doubt, search DBT!

- [Data Guides](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog/) to understand enterprise analytics subject areas that are broadly useful to the GitLab organization; managed by the Data team.

- [Documentation on data pipelines](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/pipelines/) for the technically curious analyst. This page goes into each data source and extraction details.

- [Table of data sources and refresh schedules](/handbook/enterprise-data/platform/#data-sources) to understand standard load times for each data source.

## Data Model Categories

These categories are grouped by data source and subject area.

### Service Ping

[Service Ping](https://docs.gitlab.com/development/internal_analytics/service_ping/) is GitLab's mechanism to collect data by generating a JSON payload of usage data every week to be sent to GitLab. It provides aggregated data to our Product, Customer Success, Support, and Sales teams to understand how GitLab is used. Service Ping is our only data source for understanding Self-Managed product behavior. Service Ping methodology allows us to protect our Self-Managed users' privacy by aggregating metrics at the installation level.

#### FAQs

> Is it possible to report at the namespace or user level using Service Ping data?

- Nope! As part of our [Commitment to Individual User Privacy](/handbook/product/product-processes/analytics-instrumentation-guide/service-usage-data-commitment/), GitLab only collects usage metrics aggregated at the installation level.

> What is the difference between an instance and an installation?

- An installation is the unique combination of instance_id and host_id. [Read more here](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog/self-managed/). We do Self-Managed analysis and reporting at the installation level.

| common | [fct_ping_instance_metric_none_null](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.fct_ping_instance_metric_none_null) | `dim_ping_instance_id`, `metrics_path` | Ping- and metric-level data about metrics with `none` and `null` timeframes. | |
| common_mart_product | [rpt_ping_latest_subscriptions_monthly](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_ping_latest_subscriptions_monthly) | `ping_created_date_month`, `latest_subscription_id`, `dim_installation_id` | Active Self-Managed subscriptions by month, including seat count. If a subscription sends Service Ping, then installation-level data is provided.| This includes seat count and can be used to calculate Service Ping opt-in rate |
| common_mart_product | [rpt_ping_metric_totals_w_estimates_monthly](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_ping_metric_totals_w_estimates_monthly) | `ping_created_date_month`, `metrics_path`, `ping_edition`, `estimation_grain`, `ping_edition_product_tier`, `ping_delivery_type` | This model is used for xMAU/PI reporting and is the source for Service Ping data in the [td_xmau] snippet. | |

- [Categories of data collected: Subscription, Operational, Optional](/handbook/legal/privacy/customer-product-usage-information/#what-are-the-data-collection-services-that-constitute-product-usage-data)
  - [Operational metrics](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?q=operational)
  - [Optional metrics](https://metrics.gitlab.com/?q=optional)

- Installations are randomly assigned a day of week to generate service pings, but that assignment is persistent over time. For example, if an installation is assigned Tuesdays to generate pings, it will always generate pings on Tuesdays. We generate and load service ping on different days to distribute the payload load evenly over the entire week.

- The `milestone` field of the [metrics dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/) can also be used to identify the version when a metric was instrumented, but there a couple of limitations. First, many metrics are just labeled `< 13.9`, so there is a lack of more detail for older metrics. Second, metrics can be introduced on different versions for CE and EE, so `milestone` could be incorrect for one edition/distribution. For these reasons, we recommend using [common_mart_product.rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions](https://dbt.gitlabdata.com/#!/model/model.gitlab_snowflake.rpt_ping_metric_first_last_versions) if you are looking to find out when a metric was instrumented.

### GitLab.com

GitLab.com (SaaS) is a single installation reporting a single ping within our Service Ping framework. In order to access more granular data by product tier, plan type, namespace, or user, we utilize the [GitLab.com Postgres database](/handbook/enterprise-data/organization/programs/data-for-product-managers/#gitlabcom-postgres-database). This data source replicates any service ping events that create a [backend table](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/db/docs).

#### FAQs

> Why don't all events for all Stages and Groups show up in our GitLab.com data?

- This is due to limitations in replicating Service Ping counters using the gitlab.com db Postgres replica

> Is it possible to associate user level behavior in our GitLab.com data to our Snowplow events?

- No. Our snowplow user identifiers are anonymized, while our GitLab.com user identifiers are not. However, it is possible to join Snowplow and GitLab.com data at the namespace (group/project) level.

> I've heard there are some reliability issues with our GitLab.com data. How can I stay up to date on outages or known problems?

- [This Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/12921) documents all known problems with the GitLab.com replica.

- GitLab.com data sources are not exhaustive of all of the actions users can take within GitLab's SaaS offering.

</details>

### Snowplow

Snowplow is an open source event tracking tool that is used at GitLab to track GitLab.com front-end events like page views, CTA clicks, link clicks, etc. This data source does not collect identifiable user data to protect our user's privacy. Our Snowplow data source is how we implement and track experiments at GitLab.

#### FAQs

> Why doesn't the metric that my team implemented show up in the [metrics dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/snowplow)?

- In order to show up in the [metrics dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/snowplow), every event needs a [.yml file](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/config/events). This will not happen automatically and should be created by the engineer that implements snowplow tracking.

> Why is the value for `gsc_namespace_id` null for some proportion of snowplow events?

- Engineers need to enable tracking for `gsc_namespace_id` when implementing new events. If tracking for `gsc_namespace_id` is already enabled and nulls are still occurring, the events may be triggered in a location within GitLab.com that is not specific to any one namespace like the ToDos page.

> What is the correct logic to identify events triggered in production environments?

- Apply the following logic `WHERE app_id IN ('gitlab','gitlab_customers')`

> How should I interpret the `event_category` value in structured snowplow event payloads?

- The `event_category` value will be automatically populated according to [this codified logic](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/blob/master/app/helpers/application_helper.rb?ref_type=heads#L143-143) unless the engineer instrumenting the event overrides this logic, which is often the case for backend events. A great place to search for the meaning of these values is by key word searching in [this EE controllers repository]( https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/ee/app/controllers). Controllers outside of EE are also searchable and located [here](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/tree/master/app/controllers). Otherwise, you can reach out to the engineering slack channel for the team who instrumented the event of interest and ask for validation on the correct interpretation of your `event_category` value there.

</details>

#### Good to Know

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

- If you are wondering if Snowplow events are implemented in a certain area of the product, the [Snowplow Inspector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/snowplow-inspector/maplkdomeamdlngconidoefjpogkmljm?hl=en) is a good complimentary resource to the [Metrics Dictionary](https://metrics.gitlab.com/) which is not exhaustive. The Snowplow Inspector will not show server side events.

- We do not use snowplow on our self-managed instances, only on GitLab.com

- If developers or PMs are wondering about standard implementation, the event schema is documented.

### Namespaces, users, & memberships

This category of data models includes GitLab.com (SaaS) [namespaces](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/namespace/) (which include both projects and groups), their firmographic attributes, and individual members.

#### FAQs

> What is a namespace?

- Starting with the basics! GitLab has two categories of namespaces; groups and projects. In general, a namespace provides one place to organize your related projects. Read more [here](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/namespace/). Namespaces exist within GitLab SaaS and Self-Managed products, but to protect the privacy of our Self-Managed users, we only collect identifiable namespace data for SaaS.

> What types of namespaces do we normally analyze?

- We normally perform analyses at the Ultimate parent namespace level.

> Do we have access to membership history data?

- No. Membership history at GitLab is not recorded in any data models.

#### Documentation

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

- [Data Guide to Namespace Analysis](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog/namespace/) contains comprehensive documentation on namespace analytics and example SQL code.

</details>

#### Good to Know

<details markdown="1"><summary>Click to expand</summary>

- `member_count` fields found in any `common` models are not accurate and should not be used. Use `legacy.gitlab_dotcom_memberships` for any analyses intended to measure # members per namespace. [Here is the Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-data/analytics/-/issues/12566) representing work to correct these accuracy problems.

### Duo

GitLab Duo is a suite of AI-powered features including Code Suggestions, Chat, and other capabilities. Data about Duo usage comes from multiple sources including AI Gateway events, Snowplow tracking, and Service Ping metrics, with the AI Gateway being the source of truth for usage metrics across all deployment types starting August 2024. For the most comprehensive documentation see [Data Guide to Duo Analysis](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/enterprise-data/data-governance/data-catalog/duo-analysis/).

#### FAQs

> When can we report total de-duped users across all Duo features?

- Complete de-duped totals across all features and deployment types are only available starting August 3rd, 2024. Historical data availability varies by feature and deployment type.

> How is Duo usage attributed to customers?

- Usage is attributed based on how an event happened (which namespace/installation enabled access), not where the event occurred. A single event can be enabled by multiple customers.
