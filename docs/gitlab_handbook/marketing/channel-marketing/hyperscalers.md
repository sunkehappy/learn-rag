title: Hyperscaler Campaign
---

## Naming Convention Requirements

When working with hyperscaler partners like AWS and Google Cloud, it's important to follow specific naming conventions and configuration procedures. This guide explains each component of this process in detail.

Every campaign involving a hyperscaler partner must specify the Hyperscaler Partner Name after the date:
> YYYYMMDD_HyperscalerName_Campaign_CampaignType_Region

Examples:

- 20251202_AWS_AWSreinvent_Booth
- 20250409_GCP_GoogleCloudNext_Booth
- 20241114_AWS_devops.com_ModernizingFinServe_emea_amer

If there are Hyperscaler Funds involved, ensure you include the type of Funds are applied to the Campaign after the Hyperscaler Name.

- MDF: Market Development Funds for 50% coverage
- CR: Credits for 100% coverage

Examples:

- 20250307_AWS_MDF_Campaign_CampaignType_Region
- 20250307_GCP_CR_Campaign_CampaignType_Region

Reference the [Campaigns and Programs](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/campaigns-and-programs/#hybrid-marketo-templates) page for naming conventions for specific campaign types.

## Salesforce Configuration Requirements

When setting up these campaigns in Salesforce, you need to take two critical actions:

1. Set the field `Is Hyperscaler Involved?` to `True` - This flags the campaign as a partnership activity.
2. Select the appropriate partner under the `Hyperscaler` field - Choose either:

   1. Amazon Web Services
   2. Google Cloud (Partner)

3. Select the Fund Type under `Will there be Hyperscaler Funding?`

   1. MDF
   2. Credits

This configuration ensures proper attribution and tracking of partnership activities. Note that, Hyperscaler MDF is only in referrance to AWS MDF, as that is currently the MDF that's available for GitLab.

### Campaign Types Covered by These Guidelines

These naming conventions and configuration requirements apply to all activities where hyperscalers are involved, including:

- Exhibition booths at hyperscaler-hosted events (such as Google Cloud Next or AWS Summit)
- Presence at major corporate events (like AWS reInvent)
- Joint webinars with hyperscaler partners
- Digital marketing campaigns including content syndication and advertising
- Any events or activities that utilize AWS MDF (Market Development Funds) or Google credits

### Special Instructions for Content Syndication Teams

If you work with content syndication, you have an additional step: You must update the Asset Name in the Marketo token of the Content Syndication Folder to include the Hyperscaler Name.

This ensures consistency across all platforms and makes reporting and attribution more accurate. The Marketo Program Description field has been recently updated to include a reminder about adding hyperscaler partner names to campaign names whenever these partners are involved.

Following these guidelines carefully ensures proper tracking, reporting, and compliance with partnership agreements, while also making campaigns easier to find and manage across systems.

## Hyperscaler Funded Campaign

Hyperscaler funded campaign represent a strategic partnership mechanism through which cloud hyperscalers like Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Google Cloud Platform (GCP) provide financial support to partners like GitLab for joint marketing initiatives.

Presently, the Hyperscaler funds are **only available to the Regional Marketing team**. We will be working in iteration to support additional marketing teams.

These funding programs operate under different models that reflect each hyperscaler's partnership approach:

- **AWS MDF Program**: Follows a matching investment model. This means for every dollar AWS contributes, GitLab must match with its own dollar.
- **Google Credits Program**: Unlike AWS, Google offers 100% reimbursement for approved marketing activities. This model allows GitLab to execute campaigns and receive full reimbursement upon providing proof that the activities were completed successfully.

From GitLab's perspective, these funds enable more expansive marketing campaigns than possible while strengthening strategic partnerships with major cloud providers. The partnership creates a "better together" narrative that helps customers understand the enhanced value proposition of GitLab running on these cloud platforms.

2. Update the appropriate [hyperscaler spreadsheet](/handbook/marketing/channel-marketing/hyperscalers/#application-process) with Actual MQL and Pipeline 2 weeks after the end of the event.

### Transfer Budget to Hyperscaler

When marketing teams have additional budget to spare, they can strategically [transfer funds](https://support.allocadia.com/hc/en-us/articles/360060630433-What-are-Budget-Reallocations#%23) to maximize partnership opportunities. By submitting a [budget transfer request](/handbook/enterprise-data/marketing-analytics/allocadia/#request-transfer) to the Hyperscaler Activity Plan, teams can unlock co-marketing resources, potential matching funds, and expanded collaborative campaigns. If you have any questions regarding transferring funds, please reach out to your FP&A POC.

PLEASE NOTE: FP&A is involved in this process and will be tracking all fund transfers for future budgeting.

When submitting the Zip request, it is critical to ensure the Allocadia ID reflects a positive value, which accurately supports proper financial tracking.

### Channel/Hyperscaler MDF Use Cases

In the scenario, there are multiple sources of MDF for a marketing activity, where GitLab and Hyperscaler collaborate to fund and execute marketing events. GitLab provides MDF to the partner, Hyperscaler provides MDF as reimbursement to GitLab while executing the event and handling post-event lead follow-up.

Due to Hyperscaler MDF program definition and GitLab's recent audit requirements, Hyperscaler MDF can only be paid directly to GitLab. All MDF transactions must maintain clear audit trails, with budget management centralized under the Hyperscaler hierarchy in Allocadia. While partners cannot receive Hyperscaler MDF directly, GitLab can pay third-party vendors if they provide proper invoices.

#### Step 1: Transfer Budget to Hyperscaler Allocadia Activity

1. Go to Allocadia Channel MDF
2. Click the purple "Request Transfer" button
3. Fill out the transfer request form

#### Step 2: Allocadia Setup

1. In the Hyperscaler activity plan, create event sub-category
2. Add two line items under the sub-category:
    1. Line Item 1: "Channel MDF" - Positive amount (e.g., +$3,000)
    2. Line Item 2: "Hyperscaler MDF" - Negative amount (e.g., -$3,000)

#### Step 3: Payment Processing

Determine your payment recipient carefully. Direct payments to partners are not allowed per audit requirements, but you can pay third-party vendors with proper invoices. If using the third-party approach, obtain vendor details from your partner and onboard them if they're not already in the system.

Process two separate transactions:

1. Follow the standard claim process (link to handbook page section) to receive the Hyperscaler MDF payment to GitLab
2. Pay the vendor or partner through GitLab MDF with proper invoicing documentation.

#### Step 4: GitLab Issue

1. When Regional Marketing is managing the marketing activity, follow the [Plan to WIP process](/handbook/marketing/field-marketing/#process-for-moving-events-from-plan-to-wip).
2. When Channel Marketing is managing the marketing activity, use the Channel Marketing MDF GitLab issue:

    1. Create an additional Allocadia activity:

       1. Create a Channel Marketing MDF subcategory and line item with 0 dollar value (in addition to existing Hyperscaler setup)
       2. This allows separate setup of channel marketing aspects while maintaining hyperscaler audit trail

    2. Issue and Project Setup:

       1. Create the Channel Marketing GitLab issue
       2. Follow the process flow detailed

    3. Program and Payment Coordination:

       1. Use Channel MDF line item to create Marketo program (aligns with standard channel processes)
       2. Use Hyperscaler MDF line items for Zip payment request ( funding must flow through hyperscaler hierarchy for audit compliance)

#### Triple Play

When Triple Play events involve both GitLab Channel MDF and Hyperscaler MDF, costs are divided into equal thirds among all participating parties: Partner pays 1/3, GitLab pays 1/3, Hyperscaler reimburses 1/3.

Please see more details regarding Triple Play events [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/15UBEt5n0R6Hhd2jV-SHn9TdasUAXvZCJA0flDpIBU48/edit?slide=id.g37469a251c9_0_0#slide=id.g37469a251c9_0_0).

##### Invoice Allocadia Setup

1. Invoice 1 - Channel MDF

    1. Partner receives Invoice 1 for their 1/3 of total event cost
    2. Partner follows standard MDF process for their portion (if using MDF)

       1. Line Item: Channel MDF - positive ⅓ of total event cost

    3. Alternative option: Partner may choose to self-fund their portion without MDF

2. Invoice 2 - Hyperscaler MDF

    1. GitLab receives Invoice 2 for remaining 2/3 of total event cost
    2. Process through standard Coupa workflow with outside vendor
    3. Follow existing Hyperscaler MDF process for the full 2/3 amount

       1. Line Item 1: GitLab MDF - positive 1/3 of total event cost
       2. Line Item 2: Hyperscaler MDF - negative 1/3 of total event cost (reimbursement)

    4. Hyperscaler reimburses GitLab for 1/3 (half of the 2/3 GitLab receives)
    5. Net result: GitLab pays 1/3, Hyperscaler effectively pays 1/3 through reimbursement

Example: Total Event Cost: $9,000

1. Invoice 1 to Partner: $3,000 (Partner handles via their MDF or self-funding)

    1. Channel MDF allocadia entries: $3,000 (½ of Channel MDF paid by Partner)

2. Invoice 2 to Hyperscaler: $6,000 (Hyperscaler reimburses GitLab: $3,000)

    1. Hyperscaler MDF allocadia entries: +$3,000 (½ of Channel MDF), -$3,000 (Hyperscaler MDF)

3. Final cost distribution: Partner $3,000, GitLab $3,000, Hyperscaler $3,000

### Understanding Data Flow: From Lead to Opportunity

One of the most complex aspects of hyperscaler campaigns is tracking the customer journey from initial interest to closed business. This journey involves multiple handoffs:

- Lead Identification: When a lead comes from a hyperscaler campaign, it's tagged with the appropriate CRM Partner ID and campaign information.
- Lead-to-Opportunity Conversion: As leads convert to opportunities, the system maps partner and campaign information to maintain attribution.
- Notification Systems: Automated notifications alert Cloud ESMs (Ecosystem Sales Managers) and regular ESMS are involved when new opportunities arise from hyperscaler campaigns.
- Co-Sell Integration: Labra facilitates referrals between GitLab and Hyperscalers for co-sell opportunities, creating a structured engagement process.

Understanding this flow helps teams recognize that not all Hyperscaler campaign leads will become co-sell opportunities, but tracking remains important to demonstrate overall program impact.
