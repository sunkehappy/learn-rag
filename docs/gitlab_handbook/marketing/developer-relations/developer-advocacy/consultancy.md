description: "Learn about the Developer Advocacy team's consultancy workflows and requests."
---

Teams and divisions can request consultancy in areas where [Developer Advocates are Subject Matter Experts (SME)](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/#i-classfa-fa-users-aria-hiddentruei-team-members-and-focus-areas), or can help with their experience or connection network.

## Organization

Consultancy requests are labelled using the [`DA-Consulting::` scoped labels](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/workflow/#consulting-labels), with the [`DA-Type::Consulting` label as pre-filtered list](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=DA-Type%3A%3AConsulting&first_page_size=20). Issues are grouped in a [yearly consultancy epic](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/-/work_items?sort=created_date&state=opened&label_name%5B%5D=DA-Type%3A%3AConsulting&type%5B%5D=8&first_page_size=20).

### Request developer advocate consultancy

> **Important**: Verify that the request requires help from the Developer Advocacy team before requesting consultancy. In most cases, the Solution and Demo Architects teams are the first to ask for help.

Developer Advocates and requestors can use the [`consultancy-request` issue template](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/new?issuable_template=consultancy-request).

### Decision matrix

1. [ARR](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/sales/annual-recurring-revenue-arr/) (and influenced ARR for [SKUs](https://about.gitlab.com/pricing/))
1. Aligned with [company direction](https://about.gitlab.com/direction/) and Developer Relations strategy (for example, a specific Vertical in the quarter).
1. Expertise and resources. If developer advocates cannot deliver on a specific programming language/framework, or do not have the resources to prepare for consultancy, we will deny the request and suggest alternative DRIs on the SA/CSM/Engineering teams.

## Consultancy areas

There is a wide variety of areas and topics that can be requested. It is important for Developer Advocates that requests align with their expertise and resources, and are not too broad, or without success exit criteria. All consultancy requests should be turned into opportunities to repurpose the learnings or created resources into more [content](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/).

Generally, all product areas, features and technology can be requested. The sections below document a few recent examples of requests and their results.

### GitLab Duo Agent Platform Adoption

Goal: Help customers adopt GitLab Duo Agent Platform.

Developer Advocates are encouraged to help with

- (Live) programming workshops, when fluent and confident in the requested language.
- GitLab UI and IDE setup and troubleshooting.
- Latest product updates and improvements.
- Best practice resources, demos, product tours, and use cases (see [content library](/handbook/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/content/#content-library))
- Support field teams in Slack, [#sme-ai](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C05GK6M7FBQ)

Cross-functional collaboration for customer workshops is required: [Solution Architects](/handbook/solutions-architects/) lead the [Proof of Value (PoV) workshops for GitLab Duo and AI](/handbook/solutions-architects/playbooks/pov/ai/). They get help building the workshop outline from the [SA Demo Architects](/handbook/solutions-architects/center-of-excellence/demo-architecture/) and [Customer Success Management team](/handbook/customer-success/). Developer Advocates are encouraged to help with programming workshops, IDE setup and troubleshooting, and generally sharing best practices as a developer with customer's (engineering) teams.

Customer feedback can inspire bug reports, feature proposals, documentation updates, blog tutorials, demo stories and much more. Make sure to always listen and take notes during customer engagements.

Recent customer workshop examples are available in the [pre-filtered Duo Agent Platform consulting issues](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/marketing/developer-relations/developer-advocacy/developer-advocacy-meta/-/issues/?sort=updated_desc&state=all&label_name%5B%5D=DA-Type%3A%3AConsulting&search=dap&first_page_size=20) (internal).
