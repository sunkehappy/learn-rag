Developer Relations teams use [Workato](/handbook/marketing/marketing-operations/workato/) to automate workflows between tools and platforms.

## Workato maintainers

Updated or new workflows need to be requested from the [Enterprise Technology team maintaining Workato](https://internal.gitlab.com/handbook/eta/administrative/organizational-structure/enterprise-applications-integrations/workato-playbook/).

### gitlab-blog Forum Bot

The [`gitlab-blog`](https://forum.gitlab.com/u/gitlab-blog/summary) user is used to automatically post new [GitLab blog posts](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/) as a new topic to the [Community](https://forum.gitlab.com/c/community/39) category.  This process is controlled through Workato which reads the blog RSS feed at `https://about.gitlab.com/atom.xml` and posts a new topic using the admin API key and `gitlab-blog` user for each new entry there.

The `gitlab-blog` credentials and admin API key are stored in the 1Password Marketing vault. Admins can directly edit the user in Discourse without login.

## History
