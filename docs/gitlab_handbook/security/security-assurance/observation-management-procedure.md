title: "Observation Management Procedure"
description: "This procedure details the remediation process for observations."
---

## Purpose

The Observation Management Program at GitLab is used to identify, track, remediate and provide a risk ratings of identified findings, exceptions or deficiencies for any Tier 3 information system risks that are identified as an output of compliance operations or other mechanisms by team members, such as self-identification of a system specific risk.

This procedure details the creation process for observations.

## Scope

Tier 3 risks or observations identified at the information system or business process levels

## Roles and Responsibilities

| Role | Responsibility  |
| ---- | ------ |
| Finding Coordinator | Responsible for being the observation DRI through the observation lifecycle including verifying and fine tuning recommended remediation plans in order to meet legal and regulatory requirements. |
| Remediation Owner | Validates observation, confirms assignee, due date, finalizes remediation plan and conducts remediation activity based on defined [remediation SLA's](/handbook/security/security-assurance/observation-management-procedure/#remediation-sla). |
| Managers to Executive Leadership | Responsible for escalation as necessary and resource allocation for remediation activity. |

## Procedure

Observations are one risk source within the broader Unified Risk Management (USRM) procedure. For a comprehensive overview of the program structure and workflow, refer to the [USRM handbook page](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/#procedure). This page focuses on the unique aspects of observations and how they may deviate from the standard procedure.

### Unified Risk Management (USRM) Workflow Labels

Please refer to the [USRM handbook page for workflow and required labels](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/#required-labels).

### Observation Category Labels

Labels in this set are used to categorize issues for metrics and reporting and cross-team collaboration.

| Label | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| Department::***   | Department that is responsible for remediation  |
| RiskRating:: Critical| Risk rating for security compliance observations - Critical|
| RiskRating:: High| Risk rating for security compliance observations - High|
| RiskRating:: Moderate| Risk rating for security compliance observations - Moderate|
| RiskRating::Low | Risk rating for security compliance observations - Low|
| Finding Coordinator::*** | GitLab team member managing the observation through the lifecycle. |
| Blocked:: Awaiting Remediation Owner Input    | This flag indicates the observation manager is waiting for a response from the remediation owner.   |
| Blocked:: Awaiting Observation Manager Input  | This flags the issue for the observation manager on the SecAssurance team                                                                                       |
| Blocked:: New tool implementation in progress | This flags the issue for pending completion of the new tool                                                                                                     |
| Upgraded::StORM-Managed                       | This label will be leverage when the observation has been upgraded to a tier 2 risk and will be managed in the StORM program                                    |
| Upgraded::StORM-Shared                        | This label will be leveraged when the observation has been upgraded to a tier 2 risk and remediation is shared by the Security Risk and Security Compliance team |

| NIST CSF Category:*** | Identifies observations within the NIST CSF category|
| seccomp program:***| Identifies which program or external certification is affected by the observation|
| system::***| Identifies what system is impacted by the observation|

### Identifying Observations

Observations can be identified through the following channels:

1. Security control testing activities (CCM)
1. Business Impact Analysis (BIA) activities
1. External audit activities
1. Gap assessment activities
1. Ad-hoc issues

### Risk Ratings

Tier 3 information system risk ratings are based on the formula below.

> Risk Rating = Likelihood x Impact

#### Determine the likelihood of the observation recurring

At GitLab, observations will be rated based on the likelihood the observation has recurring and/or the frequency that the control has seen observations.

| Qualitative <br> Score |  Scoring Guidelines |
| :--------------------: |  ------------------ |
| **4** | **Persistent/Systemic:** The control has recurring observations across multiple years OR the observation stems from a fundamental design flaw in the control. |
| **3** | **Frequent:** The control has generated multiple observations within the current assessment period (12 months). |
| **2** | **Occasional:** Inadequate management oversight led to this observation, with potential for recurrence. This is the only observation for this control in the current assessment period.  |
| **1** | **Rare:** Isolated incident due to atypical circumstances. Unlikely to recur once addressed. |

#### Determine the impact of the observation

*Note: When audit impact and remediation effort scores differ, use the higher score to ensure adequate attention and resources.*

| Qualitative Score | External Audit Impact | Remediation Effort |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | **Critical**: *Will* result in a documented audit finding | **Executive-level**: Requires C-suite sponsorship and cross-departmental coordination |
| 3 | **High**: *Likely* to result in a documented audit finding | **Director-level**: Requires director sponsorship and dedicated resources|
| 2 | **Medium**: *Not Likely* to result in a documented audit finding | **Manager-level**: Requires management oversight, process updates, and coordination within the department |
| 1 | **Low**: *Would not* result in audit finding | **Individual Contributor-level**: Simple reinforcement of existing processes or minor procedural clarification |

#### Determining Risk Rating

Once the likelihood and impact scores are determined, the following table can be used to determine the risk rating for the observation:

|Risk Rating|Risk Score Range|
|:---------:|:--------------:|
|Critical|16|
|High|12-15|
|Medium|4-11|
|Low|1-3|

### Observation Remediation

Once all remediation activities have been completed, the Remediation Owner is responsible for tagging the Finding Coordinator in the observation issue. If there is no Finding Coordinator assigned, tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance` in the observation issue.

It is the responsibility of the Finding Coordinator to track the milestones, work progress and validation of the remediation activity. The Finding Coordinator will then validate the remediation activity for completeness, re-test the observation (as applicable) and close the observation issue. If re-testing does not result in a fully effective conclusion, the observation description and remediation recommendations may be updated to reflect the new findings and required remediation tasks.

### Remediation SLA

Observation remediation SLA's are determined by the risk rating of the individual observation. The following table shows the SLA for each risk rating unless otherwise defined by the agreed upon remediation plan.

| Risk Rating | Remediation SLA |
| :---: | :---: |
| Critical | 3 months|
| High | 6 months|
| Medium | 12 months|
| Low | 18 months|

### Criteria for Upgrading Observations To Tier 2 Risks

<details><summary>Criteria and procedures</summary>

The observation program is a key input to the [StORM program](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program), which manages tier 2 security operational risks. When the following criteria is met, it is an indicator that a larger risk exists and is upgraded to a tier 2 operational risk and therefore included in the StORM program. This criteria is as follows:

- An observation in an entity level control
- When multiple observations share root cause and are grouped in an observation epic. Observation epics are a group of observations spanning multiple systems that have shared root cause and remediation paths.

Detailed write up:

1. Open an observation following the [Observation Intake runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/observation-management/-/blob/master/runbooks/1_Observation%20Intake%20and%20Management.md?ref_type=heads) (internal only).
1. If the observation meets the criteria for being upgraded, tag the [StORM DRI](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/#storm) and apply label ~upgraded::storm-managed if an ELC or ~upgraded:storm-shared if added to an observation epic.
    1. Definitions of labels:
        1. `Upgraded::StORM-Managed` : StORM risk managers are solely responsible for tracking remediation activities
        1. `Upgraded::StORM-Shared` : Remediation of the observation and risk is shared by the StORM risk managers and the observation manager. The StORM risk manager may track remediation activities spanning multiple systems via a common initiative, while the observation manager would be responsible for remediation of the specific system. See the [collaborative remediation](#collaborative-remediation) section for more details.
1. When the Security Risk team is tagged, someone on that team will determine if there is a risk represented for the observation meeting the criteria.
    1. If there is an existing risk, they will map the observation to the risk and leave a comment in the GitLab issues for transparency.
    1. If there is not an existing risk, they will open a new risk following the [StORM Risk Intake runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-risk-team/storm/-/blob/master/runbooks/storm-risk-intake-gl.md?ref_type=heads) (internal only).
1. An entity level control, the observation will be entirely managed by the StORM program at the tier 2 risk level, represented by the `Upgraded::StORM-Managed` label.
1. If the Observation is not an entity level control, Security Compliance will work with Security Risk for collaborative remediation with the remediation owner(s).

#### Collaborative Remediation

Security Compliance and Security Risk should look for opportunities to remediate via aggregated/common controls. In the event that observations can be remediated via a common control or implementation, activities can be tracked by the Security Risk team. For example, if we have systems that are not meeting password requirements and remediation across multiple systems involves integrating with Okta, this roll-out can be tracked by Security Risk. If remediation is system-specific, remediation activities can be tracked by Security Compliance. Remediation testing will be completed by which ever team is tracking remediation activities using the [Security Compliance remediation runbook](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/security-assurance/security-compliance-commercial-and-dedicated/observation-management/-/blob/master/runbooks/2_Remediation%20and%20Closeout.md).

### Status Labels

Defined below are status labels that will aide in the process of managing remediation of observations.

| Label| Definition|
|--|--|
|`Blocked:: Awaiting Remediation Owner Input`| This flags indicates the observation manager is waiting for response from the remediation owner. |
|`Blocked:: Awaiting Observation Manager Input`| This flags the issue for the observation manager on the SecAssurance team|
|`Blocked:: New tool implementation in progress` |This flags the issue for pending completion of the new tool|
|`Upgraded::StORM-Managed` | This label will be leverage when the observation has been upgraded to a tier 2 risk and will be managed in the StORM program|
|`Upgraded::StORM-Shared` | This label will be leverage when the observation has been upgraded to a tier 2 risk and remediation is shared by the Security Risk and Security Compliance team|
