description: "The Product Security Risk Register (PSRR) is driven by and follows the STORM process from our Security Risk Team."
---

The Product Security Risk Register (PSRR) is a centralized framework for identifying, evaluating, prioritizing, mitigating, and monitoring systemic security risks in GitLab's product.  PSRR is driven by and follows the [STORM process](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) and [Unified Security Risk Management (USRM)](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/) methodology from our [Security Risk Team](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/).

## Objectives

The PSRR reduces product security risk through:

- **Informed Prioritization**: Leverage evidence from incidents, vulnerabilities, and operational data to enable strategic investment decisions aligned with business objectives.
- **Cross-Functional Collaboration**: Coordinate Security, Engineering, and Product teams to ensure appropriate resources for systemic risk mitigation.
- **Measurable Outcomes**: Track risk treatment progress through KRIs that demonstrate impact and enable continuous improvement.
- **Enterprise Integration**: Provide product security risk intelligence to [STORM](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) and [USRM](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/) for enterprise-level escalation and visibility. Integrate into GitLab's own Operating Model planning cycles.

## Scope

The PSRR tracks systemic weaknesses, inadequate design choices, or functional logic that expose GitLab's product to compromise and data leaks, focusing on risks with cascading consequences across the platform.

**In Scope:**

- Systemic risks requiring cross-team collaboration, architectural changes, or feature development
- Risks with recurring incidents or vulnerabilities (≥5 events in 2 years)
- Security operations or product development process gaps that enable recurring vulnerabilities, incidents, or have customer-facing security impact

**Out of Scope:**

- Specific vulnerabilities (CVEs)
- Individual compliance observations
- Feature requests from security team not associated with a specific risk

## PSRR Strategy

The Product Security Risk Register (PSRR) integrates risk treatment planning into GitLab's Operating Model planning and reporting mechanisms using a top-down commitment approach. To ensure meaningful progress on complex security challenges, we align on a primary strategic risk objective for each Functional Leader. This ensures dedicated resources for systemic improvements alongside standard security operations. The proposed priorities are based on a risk impact, the business roadmap, existing work, risk evidence, and estimated effort. We will exclude any work that is already committed. The final selection, or an alternative, will be determined by each Department.

Security can act as a risk owner to drive risk reduction, even for efforts that rely on FL dependencies. These types of security-led efforts are not counted against the capacity allocated for a "Top 1 PSRR candidate," thus allowing FL resources to concentrate on new risks.

## Roles and Responsibilities

PSRR follows the [USRM roles and Authority Matrix](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/#authority-matrix). The two key roles for PSRR risks are:

| Role | Responsibility |
|------|----------------|
| **Business risk owner** | DRI for the driving risk reduction and defining treatment plan. Risk acceptance approval authority follows USRM Authority Matrix. |
| **Security risk owner** | Security team member accountable for validating the risk treatment plan and implementing risk monitoring. |

### PSRR-Specific Responsibilities

The SPA team is additionally responsible for these activities:

- Initial risk assessment, validation, and scoring
- Tracking risks through the PSRR lifecycle
- Engineering and Security leadership alignment.
- Coordinating STORM alignment and escalation

## PSRR Workflow

PSRR follows the USRM workflow with product security-specific stages:

| Stage | Entry Criteria | Key Activities | Exit Criteria |
|-------|---------------|----------------|---------------|
| **Finding Identified** | Risk discovered through assessment, incident, or escalation | - Score risk using STORM methodology<br> - Apply risk rating and scope labels <br>- Identify Business risk owner and Security risk owner | Risk scored with owner identified |
| **Remediation plan** | Business risk owner acknowledged risk | - Select risk response <br>- Define KRIs and milestones<br>- Set target dates<br>- Obtain approvals (if needed)<br>- Apply health labels | Treatment plan approved with dates |
| **Monitoring** | Treatment plan approved, resources allocated | - Execute treatment activities <br>- Onboard Technical Program Manager (if needed) <br>- Update epic status <br>- Update health labels based on progress | Remediation activities completed |
| **Monitored** | Risk response is "Monitor" - no active remediation planned | - Track KRIs monthly<br>- Review risk score quarterly<br>- Assess for priority changes<br>- Update if new incidents occur | Risk priority increases OR risk accepted/closed |
| **Closed** | Remediation validated or risk eliminated | - Security risk owner validates effectiveness<br>- Document outcome<br>- Close issue | Risk within tolerance or eliminated |

## PSRR Risk Scoring

PSRR follows [STORM risk scoring methodology](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/#risk-factors-and-risk-scoring) (Likelihood × Impact) with evidence-based adjustments using real-world data.

### Base Scoring

Start with STORM's qualitative assessment:

- **Likelihood** (1-6): Difficulty of initiating a threat event
- **Impact** (1-5): Effect on organizational objectives if event occurs

### Evidence-Based Adjustments

Evidence is collected from related security events within the past **2 years**:

- Related HackerOne reports (any severity)
- Related SIRT incidents (any severity)
- Related compliance observations

**Note:** Evidence from only one source is sufficient - the scoring methodology accounts for incomplete data across sources.

#### Likelihood Adjustment (Count-Based)

Count total evidence items across all severities:

- HackerOne reports
- SIRT incidents
- Compliance observations
- Vulnerabilities

| Total Count | Modifier |
|------------|----------|
| ≥10 items | +2 |
| ≥5 items | +1 |
| 1-4 items | 0 |
| 0 items | -1 |

**Application:** `final_likelihood = max(1, min(6, base_likelihood + modified))`

#### Impact Adjustment (Severity-Weighted)

Calculate weighted score using severity-based points:

- HackerOne and vulnerabilities `severity::1`: 3 points each
- HackerOne and vulnerabilities `severity::2`: 2 points each
- SIRT S1: 3 points each
- SIRT S2: 2 points each
- Observations Critical: 3 points each
- Observations High: 2 point each

| Weighted Score | Modifier |
|---------------|----------|
| ≥10 points | +2 |
| ≥5 items | +1 |
| 1-4 points | 0 |
| 0 points | -1 |

**Application:** `final_impact = max(1, min(5, base_impact + impact_mod))`

### Final Risk Score

`Risk Score = final_likelihood × final_impact`

This score (1-30) determines the `RiskRating::` and `psrr-risk-rating::` labels applied during the `prioritised` stage.

Manual validation of evidence and base score is applied if evidence-based modifiers and base scoring appear contradictory (for example, base likelihood=1 but ≥5 incidents, or base impact=1 but weighted score ≥10).

## Key Risk Indicators (KRIs)

Key Risk Indicators are measurable metrics that track whether a risk is increasing, decreasing, or stable over time. KRIs are defined during the `treatment-plan-defined` stage and tracked throughout the risk lifecycle.

KRIs are reviewed during monthly PSRR reviews, see health KRI definitions.

### Quick Decision Guide: Which KRI Type to Use?

| Your Situation | Primary KRI | Example Metrics | Thresholds |
|----------------|----------|-----------------|------------|
| **"New risk, zero incidents"** | **Implementation:** Measure control adoption (Leading) | **Control:** 45% of images with SLSA provenance<br>**Exposure:** 550 images without attestation<br>**Trend:** +50 unprotected images this quarter | **Green:** Coverage ≥95% OR trending down ≥20%/quarter<br>**Yellow:** Coverage 75-94% OR flat<br>**Red:** Coverage <75% OR increasing |
| **"High incident frequency (≥5/quarter)"** | **Effectiveness:** <br>Incidents (Lagging) + Predictive (Bayesian) | **Historical:** 30 leaks in 6 months, avg 500 unscoped secrets<br>**Current:** 650 unscoped secrets<br>**Predicted:** 6.5 leaks this month<br>**Actual:** 5 leaks last month | **Green:** Predicted ≤ baseline AND incidents decreasing<br>**Yellow:** Predicted 1.5-2x baseline<br>**Red:** Predicted >2x baseline |
| **"Rare but severe attack"** | **Implementation:** <br>Measure exposure (Leading) | **Exposure:** 23% of traffic on HTTP/1 protocol<br>**Critical:** 2 authentication endpoints on HTTP/1<br>**Trend:** -5% reduction from last quarter | **Green:** Trending down ≥20%/quarter<br>**Yellow:** Flat or <20% decrease<br>**Red:** Increasing |
| **"I don't have inventory"** | **Define alternative collection:**<br>Sampling or Experimentation | **Sampling:** Audit 10% of repos (50 of 500) for exposed secrets → 8% found secrets<br>**Experimentation:** Red team test of 5 critical endpoints → 2 bypassable | **Green:** Sample shows <5% issues<br>**Yellow:** Sample shows 5-15% issues<br>**Red:** Sample shows >15% issues |

**Note:** Most risks should use multiple KRI types.

**When observation is impossible or insufficient:**

**Sampling** - Analyze representative subset:

- Random sampling: Equal probability selection. Example: test 10% of container images
- Stratified sampling: Sample from each category Example: 5 repos per engineering team
- **Use when**: Large populations, resource constraints, lack of baseline or inventory

**Experimentation** - Controlled tests to measure risk exposure:

- Red team exercises: Simulate real-world attacks
- Security audits: Manual review of configurations
- Penetration tests: Validate control effectiveness
- **Use when**: No historical incidents, need to validate assumptions

## Risk Closure Criteria

A PSRR risk may be closed when **all** of the following are met:

1. **Risk Score Within Tolerance**

   - Final risk score ≤ Risk tolerance threshold
   - Reassessment shows sustained reduction (not temporary)

2. **KRI Targets Achieved**

   - Implementation KRIs: Control coverage meets minimum thresholds (typically ≥95%)
   - Effectiveness KRIs: Incident rates demonstrate sustained reduction (90+ days below baseline)
   - Efficiency KRIs: Response times meet SLA targets

3. **Security risk owner Validation**

   - Reviews all remediation evidence
   - Confirms controls are operating effectively
   - Validates that root cause has been addressed
   - Treatment outcomes documented
   - Documents closure rationale in issue

## PSRR Label Schema

PSRR extends USRM labels with product security-specific labels for risk categorization, scoring, workflow tracking, and health monitoring.

### Required Labels

#### Risk Rating (from STORM)

- `RiskRating::Critical` - Score 26-30
- `RiskRating::High` - Score 21-25
- `RiskRating::Medium` - Score 11-20
- `RiskRating::Low` - Score 1-10

#### PSRR Risk Score (numeric)

- `psrr-risk-rating::<number>` - Any score from 1-30 (such as `psrr-risk-rating::25`)

#### PSRR Scope (risk category)

- `psrr-scope::<category>` - Examples: `product-authnz`, `infrastructure`, `supply-chain`, `secrets-management`, `operational`

#### PSRR Owners

- `Department::<group>|<section>|Engineering or section::` - Department following [product categories](/handbook/product/categories/features/)
- `security-owner::<team>` - Security team owning risk based on [security team structure](/handbook/security/)

#### Workflow and status

Refer to [USRM labels](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/#usrm-label-reference) including `risk-acceptance::active` and `Blocked` labels.

#### Health Indicators

All three health labels are required for each PSRR risk:

| Health Domain | Labels | Red | Yellow | Green |
|---------------|--------|-----|--------|-------|
| Owner | `health-owner::red\|yellow\|green` | No Business risk owner assigned | Assigned but inactive/needs replacement | Regular syncs (≥quarterly) |
| Treatment Plan | `health-treatment::red\|yellow\|green` | No treatment plan or missing dates | Defined but delayed >1 quarter | On track, delays ≤1 quarter |
| KRI | `health-kri::red\|yellow\|green` | Undefined or untracked | Defined, provides partial context | Defined, linked to impact/likelihood |

### Optional Labels

#### STORM Integration

- `STORM Risk:1` through `STORM Risk:5` - Risk mapped to one of STORM's Top 5 Risks.
- `STORM::Proposed` - Risk proposed for escalation to STORM risk based on business impact and strategic alignment.

## Triage Bot Automation

PSRR adopts [GitLab Triage Bot](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage) using recommended [USRM policies](/handbook/security/security-observations-risk-management/#required-triage-bot-policies) to:

- **Enforce PSRR labels** - Flags issues missing psrr-risk-rating, psrr-scope, or health-* labels
- **Validate health indicators** - Ensures health labels match actual risk status (example: No owner but green status).

## Integration with STORM

PSRR risks may escalate to [STORM](/handbook/security/security-assurance/security-risk/storm-program/) based on business impact and strategic alignment. All PSRR risks are also linked to their STORM related risk.
