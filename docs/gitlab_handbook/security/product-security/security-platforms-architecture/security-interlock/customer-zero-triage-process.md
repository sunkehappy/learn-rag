## New Customer Zero Requests

When Customer Zero requests are created using our [request templates](../security-interlock/request-customer-zero-validation.md), they are automatically labeled with `C0Workflow::Backlog`, which makes them visible on [this issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engagements/product-security-requests/-/boards/9306316) (internal only).

Triagers may choose to subscribe to the `~C0Workflow::Backlog` label and/or periodically monitor the board to identify new issues that need to be triaged.

## How to Triage New Issues

### Automated

The [Automate the Customer Zero Triage Process](https://gitlab.com/groups/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engineering/-/epics/45) epic automated each manual step below by leveraging [gitlab-triage](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/ruby/gems/gitlab-triage) and GitLab Duo. For most cases, each new issue should be triaged without manual intervention but in the event GitLab Duo is unable to determine the responsible team, Duo will comment this fact and mention the [Product Security Engineering](/handbook/security/product-security/security-platforms-architecture/product-security-engineering/) team who will triage the issue using the steps below.

### Temporary workaround process

In the event the automated triaging is not working, you can ask Duo to suggest a team by:

1. Ensure the page you're on is the Work item that needs triaging.
1. Bring up Duo chat and paste in the following prompt:

   ```plain
   Please determine which team is responsible for this GitLab Issue out of the following list of teams:

   * Application Security Team
   * PSIRT
   * Vulnerability Management Team
   * Product Security Engineering Team
   * Security-Platforms-Architecture Team

   Ensure the responsible team is formatted **<TEAM>insert team name here</TEAM>**.
   ```

1. Use the response from Duo to guide the team labels to apply.

### Manual steps

1. Select an issue that does NOT start with the prefixes `DRAFT:` or `WIP:`. Those issues are ones that submitters have started, but they still need to provide additional information before we review them. That's fine! We'd prefer to have visibility into what's coming anyway.
1. Apply the label `~"C0Workflow::Initial Triage"` to indicate that someone is already triaging this issue so no one duplicates your efforts. You can do this manually or by moving the Issue to the next column on the [issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engagements/product-security-requests/-/boards/9306316) (internal only). If your triage takes more than just a few minutes, assign the issue to yourself so this shows up in your TODOs and you don't lose track.
1. Review the information provided in the Issue and determine if sufficient information has been provided for someone to work it. For example, are all of the key fields populated? Do you understand the feature and have all of the information you'd need to do a review?
   - **If Not**: Tag the requestor and key contacts in a comment and ask them clarifying questions. Apply the label `~"C0::Waiting on Requestor"` to the Issue manually or by moving it to the next column on the [issue board](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engagements/product-security-requests/-/boards/9306316) (internal only). Ask that they tag you directly when they've provided the additional information so you can re-review and follow the next steps.
1. Once you have determined there is sufficient information in the Issue, first set the milestone appropriately, given both the Timeline Requirements in the Issue and our [SLOs](../security-interlock/request-customer-zero-validation/#timeline-expectations), which state requests received at least 10 calendar days before the next milestone starts should have feedback provided within the next milestone. Requests received later than that will typically be prioritized for milestone+2.
1. Determine which team(s) are best suited to provide the appropriate feedback. If you are unsure which teams' feedback is required, ask in `#product-security-department-only`. Once you have determined the appropriate team(s), take the following steps:

    | Team | Steps |
    | ------- | ------- |
    | AppSec | 1. Apply the `~"Application Security Team"` label<br/> 2. Tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec` and ask them to incorporate into their milestone planning |
    | PSIRT | 1. Apply the `~"PSIRT"` label<br/> 2. Tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/appsec/psirt-group` and ask them to incorporate into their milestone planning |
    | Vuln Management | 1. Apply the `~"Vulnerability Management Team"` label<br/> 2. Tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/vulnerability-management` and ask them to incorporate into their milestone planning |
    | ProdSecEng | 1. Apply the `~"Product Security Engineering Team"` label<br/> 2. Tag `@gitlab-com/gl-security/product-security/product-security-engineering` and ask them to incorporate into their milestone planning |
    | Not Listed | Tag team members individually, and update this Handbook page if you receive alternate instructions |

1. Apply the label `~"C0Workflow::On Deck"` to indicate this has been triaged and assigned.

You're Done!
