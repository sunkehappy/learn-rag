## Understanding the GitLab system checker

### What is the GitLab system checker

The GitLab system checker is a setup using scheduled pipelines to check the status of GitLab. It is specifically checking the following:

- Customer Support Operations projects containing more than 50 pending CI/CD jobs
- Customer Support Operations projects containing CI/CD jobs running for longer than 25 minutes

It posts to the [#css-audit-events Slack channel](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04A6E1KB89).

### How does it work

At the top of every hour UTC (`0 * * * *`), a scheduled pipeline causes the `bin/run` script to execute. This does the following:

- Iterates over a list of projects, checking:
  - How many pending CI/CD jobs they have
    - If the value exceeds 50, it stores the information to an array of problems
  - How many CI/CD jobs running that have exceeded 25 minutes of runtime
    - If there are any, it stores the information to an array of problems
- Posts in the [#css-audit-events Slack channel](https://gitlab.enterprise.slack.com/archives/C04A6E1KB89) for each piece of information in the array of problems

## Changing the GitLab system checker

{{% alert title="Note" color="primary" %}}

- This requires at least `Developer` access to the project.
- This should only be done if there is a corresponding request issue (Feature Request, Administrative, Bug, etc.). If one does not exist, you should first create one (and let it go through the standard process before working it).

To make changes to the GitLab system checker, you will need to create a MR in the project repo. The exact changes being made will depend on the request itself.

After a peer reviews and approves your MR, you can merge the MR (which will have them applied on the next triggered run).

## Common issues and troubleshooting

This is a living section that will have items added to it as needed.
