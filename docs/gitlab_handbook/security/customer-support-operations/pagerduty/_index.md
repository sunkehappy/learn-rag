This guide covers how Customer Support Operations works with and uses with Pagerduty at GitLab.

## Understanding Pagerduty

### What is Pagerduty

PagerDuty is a SaaS-based incident management platform that helps IT, DevOps, and security teams prevent and resolve business-impacting issues by automating alerts, orchestrating responses, and providing real-time visibility into operations, ensuring the right people are notified at the right time to minimize downtime and improve customer experience. It collects alerts from monitoring tools, uses on-call schedules and escalation policies, and offers AI for incident summarization and automation.

### How we manage items in Pagerduty

We currently manage all Pagerduty items within Pagerduty itself.

For information on paging Customer Support Operations or being oncall for Customer Support Operations, please see our [Oncall documentation](/handbook/security/customer-support-operations/pagerduty/oncall).
