This guide explains how Customer Support Operations uses GitLab labels.

## Understanding labels

### What are labels

Labels organize and track work across GitLab features. As projects grow from small teams to large organizations, labels help you track and manage increasing volumes of work. Labels:

- Categorize issues, merge requests, and epics with custom attributes.
- Filter content in lists and boards.
- Prioritize work items with colors and descriptive titles.
- Track priority and severity with scoped labels.
- Structure workflows through organized groupings.

For Customer Support Operations, labels provide structured categorization of requests, enable workflow tracking through issue boards, and help prioritize and route work across the team.

## Labels used by Customer Support Operations

### Stage labels

These are used to indicate what stage an issue is currently at.

| `Stage::Planning` | It is here a gameplan for the issue will be created |
| `Stage::Scheduling` | It is here that when to work an issue will be determined |
| `Stage::Queued` | It is here issues being worked in the future wait |

## Applying a label

To apply a label to an issue or merge request, you can either click `Edit` next to `Labels` on the right-side panel of the issue/merge request or you can use the [label quick command](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/quick_actions/#label):

```plaintext
/label ~"TITLE_OF_LABEL"
```

Note: The tilde (`~`) is required and you should replace `TITLE_OF_LABEL` with the title of the label itself. As an example:

```plaintext
/label ~"Stage::Planning"
```

## Removing a label

To remove a label from an issue or merge request, you can either click `Edit` next to `Labels` on the right-side panel of the issue/merge request or you can use the [unlabel quick command](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/quick_actions/#unlabel):

```plaintext
/unlabel ~"TITLE_OF_LABEL"
```

Note: The tilde (`~`) is required and you should replace `TITLE_OF_LABEL` with the title of the label itself. As an example:

```plaintext
/unlabel ~"roadmap_item"
```
