## Understanding issue boards

### What are issue boards

As per [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/user/project/issue_board/):

> Issue boards provide a visual way to manage and track work in GitLab. Issue boards:
>
> - Display issues as cards in customizable lists based on labels, milestones, or assignees.
> - Track issues through different stages of your workflow.
> - Support agile methodologies like Kanban and Scrum.
> - Organize multiple boards for different teams and projects.
> - Visualize workload and progress across your entire process.

Customer Support Operations uses our issue boards to:

- get an overview of issues we have to work
- move issues quickly between stages
- plan upcoming workloads and iterations

## Current issue boards

Customer Support Operations use issues boards to get a quick overview of our workload. Here we detail the primary ones we use and how they are setup.

### Stages
