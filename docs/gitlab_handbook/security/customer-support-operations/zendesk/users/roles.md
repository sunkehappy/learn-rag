## Understanding roles

### What are Zendesk user roles

Zendesk uses Roles as a way to maintain permission sets for agents.

### How we manage roles

We currently manage all roles within Zendesk itself.

### Current roles in use

{{% alert title="Note" color="danger" %}}

This should be the single source of truth for the roles used. Never make changes outside of approved workflows.

Always be cautious of changes. Many of these can have significant downstream impacts.

For more information on what permissions the roles have, please see [this doc](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1geQ3AYmlAUVFdgLusQVCaoNacV2yOHULjN2L7LP8rT0/edit?usp=sharing) (internal).

## Creating a role as a non-admin

For the creation of a role, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Editing a role as a non-admin

For the modification of a role, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Deleting a role as a non-admin

To request the deactivation of a role, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Requesting a role change

All Zendesk role changes follow this approval process:

1. **Submit Request**: File an [access request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/team-member-epics/access-requests/-/issues/new?description_template=Individual_Bulk_Access_Request)
1. **Manager Approval**: The requester's manager must approve the request
1. **Security Review**: A Fullstack Engineer, Customer Support Operations reviews the business justification
1. **Decision**: If approved, Customer Support Operations will make the needed changes

## Administrator tasks
