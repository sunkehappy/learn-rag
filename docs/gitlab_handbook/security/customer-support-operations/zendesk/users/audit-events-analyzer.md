## Understanding Audit Events Analyzer

### What is Audit Events Analyzer

Audit Events Analyzer is a combination of Zendesk webhooks and CI/CD scripts that analyze specific types of audit events and notify the Customer Support Operations team accordingly.

### How does Audit Events Analyzer work

Utilizing [Zendesk User events webhooks](https://developer.zendesk.com/api-reference/webhooks/event-types/user-events/), CI/CD pipelines are triggered with a payload (sent by the webhook) in the corresponding project (based on the Zendesk instance). The current monitored user events are:

- Support user role changed

When the CI/CD pipeline is created, the script `bin/analyze` runs, which does the following:

- Checks if the event was a role downgrade (new role is `end-user` OR an `admin` was made into an `agent`)
  - If it was, it exits with a status code of 0
- Checks if the event was a light agent upgrade (previous role was `end-user`, new role is `agent`, and the email ends with `@gitlab.com`)
  - If it was, it exits with a status code of 0
- If the upgraded user's previous role was `end-user`, a post to Slack is made using the `@channel` tag
- If the upgraded user's previous role was `agent`, a post to Slack is made using the `@here` tag

### Modifying the Audit Events Analyzer project

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

- This should only be done if there is a corresponding request issue (Feature Request, Administrative, Bug, etc.). If one does not exist, you should first create one (and let it go through the standard process before working it).

To modify the Audit Events Analyzer project, you will need to create a MR in the project repo. The exact changes being made will depend on the request itself.

After a peer reviews and approves your MR, you can merge the MR. Being this is an `Ad-hoc` deployment type, the changes will be live immediately.

### Modifying the webhooks

For information on modifying webhooks, see our documentation on [Webhooks](/handbook/security/customer-support-operations/zendesk/webhooks/).
