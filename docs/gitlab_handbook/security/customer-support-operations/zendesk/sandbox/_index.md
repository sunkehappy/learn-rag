## Understanding sandboxes

### What is the Zendesk Sandbox

As per [Zendesk](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/4408822049818-Creating-a-sandbox-environment-to-test-changes):

> Sandbox environments provide a test environment that closely mirrors your production instance in configuration and some data. This allows you to accurately test updates to workflows, experiment with integrations, and provide training for new agents in an environment that reflects your production environment.

The Zendesk Sandbox is a replica Zendesk instance you can use to test, learn, replicate, etc. in an environment that is separated from production instances.

We utilize the Zendesk Sandbox in all our change management processes. This allows us a safe and secure place to test changes/updates/etc. so we can ensure the implementations we push into production are both stable and well vetted.

### Common use cases

- Testing trigger and automation changes before production deployment
- Experimenting with new workflows
- Training new team members
- Validating app configurations
- Testing theme modifications

### Where are the sandboxes?

You can locate the sandboxes via:

- [Zendesk Global](https://gitlab1707170878.zendesk.com/agent/)
- [Zendesk US Government](https://gitlabfederalsupport1585318082.zendesk.com/agent)

### How to access the Zendesk Sandbox

For testing end-user workflows (ticket submission, portal access, etc.), use the pre-configured test accounts listed in the [Zendesk Sandbox Test Orgs and Users](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1g6lJ3AUS4EYqoBYzAdExp4v1dkzOb3GWKaMIoZikjts/edit?usp=sharing) (internal only) spreadsheet. These accounts simulate different customer scenarios (free users, paid users, various subscription levels, etc.).

You should use the pre-created test organizations and users whenever possible. If for some reason the users there will not work in your case, please contact the Fullstack Engineer for Support Operations.

### Sandbox limitations

- API rate limits may differ from production
- License seat counts differ from production
- Some integrations may not work or have not been setup

### Creating a Sandbox

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

- This should only be done if there is a corresponding request issue (Feature Request, Administrative, Bug, etc.). If one does not exist, you should first create one (and let it go through the standard process before working it).
