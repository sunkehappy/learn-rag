This guide covers how to create, edit, and manage Zendesk trigger categories at GitLab. Administrators should review the [Administrator tasks](#administrator-tasks) section.

- Deployment type: `Ad-hoc`
  - **Note:** Trigger categories are currently managed manually in Zendesk (no sync repo yet)

## Understanding trigger categories

### What are trigger categories

Trigger categories are used to both group triggers and fine tune the run order (position) of triggers.

Common use cases for trigger categories include:

- Grouping by function
- Grouping by team
- Grouping by region
- Grouping by priority
- Further fine-tuning run-order (positioning)

When you assign a trigger to a category (via the `category_id` attribute in the trigger's YAML file), it appears under that category heading in the Zendesk triggers list, making it easier to navigate large numbers of triggers.

### Trigger categories impact run order

When triggers run, they run in "groups" based off the trigger categories. And in those groups, the position of the trigger category is taken into effect.

So in a setup of the following (shown in order of positions):

- Category 1
  - Trigger 1
  - Trigger 6
- Category 2
  - Trigger 2
  - Trigger 5
- Category 3
  - Trigger 3
  - Trigger 4

The run order would be:

1. Trigger 1
1. Trigger 6
1. Trigger 2
1. Trigger 5
1. Trigger 3
1. Trigger 4

### How we manage trigger categories

We currently manage all trigger categories within Zendesk itself.

## Creating trigger categories as a non-admin

For the creation of a trigger category, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Editing trigger categories as a non-admin

For the modification of a trigger category, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Deleting trigger categories as a non-admin

For the deletion of a trigger category, please create a [Feature Request issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-com/gl-security/corp/cust-support-ops/issue-tracker/-/issues/new?description_template=Feature) (as it will require manual intervention by the Customer Support Operations team).

## Administrator tasks

### Creating a trigger category

{{% alert title="Warning" color="warning" %}}

- This should only be done if there is a corresponding request issue (Feature Request, Administrative, Bug, etc.). If one does not exist, you should first create one (and let it go through the standard process before working it).
